Ah, you are learning the language of the web! And you should definitely know about the workflow of the web :) CLI is the best way for you to start the GitHub workflow. As the semster progresses, you will get to know your computer better and using the CLI more effectively for your projects -- be it styling your writing with CSS or coding out interactive features with Javascript.
